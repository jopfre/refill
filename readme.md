# Refill

This is a prototype for Refill, an organisation who maps water bottle refill points internaitonally.

This version allows adding markers for refill points to a map.

The markers are stored in Firebase and are also accessible from a wordpress site. See https://github.com/jopfre/refill-theme for the child theme.

The app is built with React Native, Redux and Redux Saga.
